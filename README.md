# Employees and Departments 


Create a new Spring Boot application for Employees and Departments. Each Employee can work in only one Department. Each Department can have many Employees. Your application should be able to add, update and delete employees and also departments.

For this exercise Bootstrap is not important .... focus on functionality.

Hint: Start with H2 and get the database right first before creating all the thymeleaf code. Simply create a basic index page and browse to that once to create the database. Then view the tables in /h2-console and make sure they are correct.

Instructions from a weekly challenge:


**Your application must include the following:**
- A table for employees
- Each employee should have a name, job title, and the name of the department they work under
- A table for departments
- A page listing all departments
- A page listing all employees and their departments
- Be able to add one or more departments
- Be able to add one or more employees
- Be able to update, view details of, and delete employees
- Functionality is most important but include some bootstrap to make the pages look nice

**Extra (not graded, but will be good to know):**

- Add cloudinary to have employees upload a picture
- Publish it to Heroku ( Hint - use postgresql)
